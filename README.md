# Redesign of Lakshadweep's Tourism Website

In this project, we studied human-computer interaction (HCI), analyzed the usability 
of Lakshadweep’s tourism website, and redesigned it guided by HCI principles
and user experiments. The goal of the project is to apply HCI principles to the
usability analysis of an existing website.
Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and story boarding made the data flow easier
to interpret and the heuristic principles guided us in the completion of this project.


We redesigned the website based on this analysis and by conducting user experiments
to compare the redesign against the existing Lakshadweep tourism website.
With this project, we redesigned a website that demonstrably improves users’ success
at information seeking and navigation while reducing frustration and hassle
compared to the current Lakshadweep tourism website.
This project is available online on GitHub, hosted using Heroku at https://lakshwadeep-travel-guide.herokuapp.com/.
